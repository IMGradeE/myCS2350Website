        <p class="hiddenP">This repository contains my submissions from a one-hour mock technical interview that my Object Oriented Programming
            teacher conducted during one of the sessions. It was a fun challenge for me, and I was impressed with the
            solutions I was able to come up with in such a short period of time. I was also the only student that completed
            all the problems in the specified time frame, though there is an error in one of the programs in an edge case
            if memory serves.</p>

    </a></div><p class="hiddenP">
        This Repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms final project. This project was frustrating because
        the requirements we were given did not mention the fact that 70% of the score was based on "optional added functionality"
        so I wrote a simple version the day it was assigned and went on with the semester. Much later on, the professor
        elaborated on the requirements and I had to come up with and implement a bunch of features on extremely short notice
        which lead to some painful refactoring and scope creep.

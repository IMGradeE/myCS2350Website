                    In this game a player takes turns with the computer choosing a number of stones between 1 and 3 to
                    remove from the central pool. The game ends when the last stone is taken, and the player who took
                    the last stone is declared the winner. I added functionality that renders the text with audio in a
                    manner reminiscent of Animal Crossing's Animalese.

                    This repository contains my submissions from a one-hour mock technical interview that my Object Oriented Programming
                    teacher conducted during one of the sessions. It was a fun challenge for me, and I was impressed with the
                    solutions I was able to come up with in such a short period of time. I was also the only student that completed
                    all the problems in the specified time frame, though there is an error in one of the programs in an edge case
                    if memory serves.

                    project in the CS2350 course that uses pure html & css. Everything from this point forward uses JavaScript,
                    which I am excited for. Front-end programming is not really my thing.

                    This Repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms final project. This project was frustrating because
                    the requirements we were given did not mention the fact that 70% of the score was based on "optional added functionality"
                    so I wrote a simple version the day it was assigned and went on with the semester. Much later on, the professor
                    elaborated on the requirements and I had to come up with and implement a bunch of features on extremely short notice
                    which lead to some painful refactoring and scope creep.

                        None of the projects are significant enough to have their own repository,
                        but they're all interesting enough to me that I still wanted to compile all of them into a central location
                        so that I can share them with my son or just look back on my growth as a Computer Scientist in the future.
